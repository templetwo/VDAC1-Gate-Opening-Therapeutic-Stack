## The Problem

Microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer represents ~85% of all CRC cases and is functionally invisible to checkpoint immunotherapy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy response rate is below 5%. The tumor microenvironment stays immunologically cold because there is no innate immune signal to "uncheck."

## The Insight

The voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as a molecular gate. When jammed shut by three physical locks (HK-II, Bcl-xL, cholesterol), it prevents mtDNA from escaping into the cytosol. Without cytosolic mtDNA, the cGAS-STING innate immune sensing pathway remains silent. Checkpoint inhibitors fail because there is no immune response to uncheck.

## The Solution

```
Lovastatin (strips the cholesterol lock)
  -> VDAC1 oligomerizes -> mtDNA escapes -> cGAS-STING fires -> IFN-B
    -> Botensilimab + balstilimab amplifies innate -> adaptive immunity
      -> Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells attack the now-visible tumor
```
