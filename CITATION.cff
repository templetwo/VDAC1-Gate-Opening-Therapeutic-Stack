abstract: >-
  Strategic architecture document reformulating the VDAC1 gate-opening
  therapeutic hypothesis for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer.
  Three fatal contradictions in the original three-phase hypothesis
  (TSPO inhibition, immune activation, CBD apoptosis) were identified
  through critical literature review. The surviving architecture centers
  on statin-mediated cholesterol depletion from the outer mitochondrial
  membrane to enable VDAC1 oligomerization and mtDNA release, followed
  by botensilimab-amplified immune activation. Includes six critical
  experiments with explicit falsification triggers.
