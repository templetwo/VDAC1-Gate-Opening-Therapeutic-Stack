## Figure 1: The VDAC1 Gate-Opening Therapeutic Sequence

Three-panel diagram showing the mechanistic progression:

- **Panel A** - The Triply-Locked Gate: Cold TME, no IFN-B signal, cGAS-STING silent, VDAC1 gate jammed shut by HK-II + Bcl-xL + cholesterol. GJS equation with all three terms elevated.
- **Panel B** - Lovastatin Opens the Gate: Cholesterol stripped from OMM, VDAC1 oligomerizes, mtDNA escapes, cGAS-STING fires. Dual-pathway mechanism (Pathway A: cholesterol depletion, Pathway B: CoQ10/ROS).
- **Panel C** - The Botensilimab Cavalry: Innate amplification (FcgRIIIa on macrophages/NK), Treg elimination (ADCC), activated CD8+ T cells unleashed against now-visible MSS CRC tumor.

Available in PDF (print) and interactive HTML/SVG formats.

## Figure 2: GJS Equation Simulation

Four computational panels generated by `simulations/gjs_simulation.py`:

- **Panel A (2a)** - 2D line plots: Apoptotic threshold vs [Chol]/[CL] ratio at varying TSPO lock strengths
- **Panel B** - 3D surface: Threshold as function of f_TSPO and [Chol]/[CL] with f_HKII=0.8, f_BclxL=0.8
- **Panel C (2c)** - Heatmap: Log-scale threshold with synergy zone highlighted
- **Panel D (2d)** - Bar chart: Cancer baseline (250.0) vs lovastatin alone (83.3, 3.0x) vs PK11195 alone (93.8, 2.7x) vs dual lock (31.3, 8.0x)

## Figure 2e: Chou-Talalay Combination Index Analysis

Three-panel analysis generated by `simulations/gjs_chou_talalay_calculator.py`:

- **Panel A** - Isobologram at 87.5% threshold reduction: tests whether combination curve falls below the additivity line
- **Panel B** - CI predictions across effect levels: independent targets predict CI=1.0 (Loewe additivity), cooperativity would yield CI<0.8
- **Panel C** - Therapeutic advantage: multiplicative pharmacology > additive, even without true synergy (8x vs additive prediction)

Key insight: GJS multiplicative structure guarantees 8x benefit at CI=1.0 because locks act on independent terms in the denominator.
